My Bride
========

I thought I should dedicate a page to my wife, Madison, the most
beautiful woman ever to walk this earth. Here are a just few things I
love about her:

#. Her hazel eyes, especially when they sparkle as she smiles, or
   even when they softly glow when she is sad.

#. Her cheerful, friendly personality.

#. Her soft golden blonde hair, especially how it falls down her back.

#. Her heart for caring for others in need.

#. Her beautiful voice and musical talent, especially when she sings
   and writes songs and plays guitar in the living room.

#. Her passion to grow our marriage into the best it can be.

Oh Madison, I love you more than you will ever be able to feel it
